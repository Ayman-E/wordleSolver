# wordleSolver

Friends wanted to play wordle, I decided to make an extra tool to assist me.

Currently the algorithm will print out the possible answers depending on your input
It will also give you a recommended word to guess based on the frequency of the letters from each possible answer

Further steps:
Fix a couple issues where words should be getting removed from the possible answers but they aren't

Make the recommended word better by having it not have duplicate letters
